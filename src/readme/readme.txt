--------
1) The button exists on child.
2) When this button on child component is clicked, we pass some data from child component to a function in parent component.
3) The trigger of the event exists in child component(e.g. button click), and so the @Output and EventEmitter() also exist in the child component.
4) In simple words, appchild component is the sender of an event and appparent is the receiver of the said event.
